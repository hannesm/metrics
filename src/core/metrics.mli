(** Metrics Monitoring.

   [Metrics] provides a basic infrastructure to monitor metrics using
   time series. {{!func}Monitoring} is performed on {{!srcs}sources},
   indexed by {{!tags}tags}. Tags allow users to select at runtime
   which metric sources is producing data points. Disabled
   data-sources have a low runtime cost (only a closure allocation)
   which make [Metrics] suitable to instrument production systems.

    Both sources tags and data-points are built using dictionaries of
   typed entries called {{!fields}fields}.

    [Metrics] is heavily inspired by
   {{:http://erratique.ch/software/logs}Logs} as it decouples metric
   reporting is from metric monitoring. This is handled by custom
   {{!reporter}reporters}.

(** {2:data Data points} *)

(** [Data] defines what is stored in the time series. *)
module Data: sig

  (** {2 Data}

      [Metric]'s data points are a list of typed fields with an
      optional timestamp. They are created with the {!v} and
      {{!fields}field} constructors.

      For instance, to create a data point with two values ["%CPU"] and
      ["MEM"], respectively of type [float] and [int]:

      {[
let x = Data.v [
  float "%CPU" 0.42;
  int   "MEM"  27_000;
]
     ]}
  *)

  type t
  (** The type for data points. *)

  type timestamp = string
  (** The type for timestamp. A timestamp shows the date and time, in
     RFC3339 UTC, associated with particular data. *)

  val timestamp: t -> timestamp option
  (** [timestamp t] is [t]'s timestamp (if any). If it is [None], then
     the reporter will add a new timestamp automatically. *)

  val v: ?timestamp:timestamp -> field list -> t
  (** [v ?timestamp f] is the measure [f], as a the list metric name
     and value, and the timestamp [timestamp]. If [timestamp] is not
     provided, it will be set be the reporter. Raise
     [Invalid_argument] is a key or a value contains an invalid
     character.  *)

  val keys: t -> key list

(** {2:tags Tags} *)

(** [Tags] indexes metric sources, and allow to enable/disable data
    collection at runtime. *)
module Tags: sig

  (** {2 Tags}

      [Tags] are heterogeneous {{!t}lists} of key names and type of values,
     which are associated to data sources. Filters on key names allow
     to select which data sources is {{!enabling}enabled} at runtime. Disabled data
     sources have a very low cost -- only allocating a closure.

      For instance, to define the tags "PID", "IP" and "host",
      respectively of type [int], [Ipaddr.t]:
{[
let ipaddr = Tags.v Ipaddr.pp_hum
let t = Tags.[
  int    "PID" ;
  ipaddr "IP"  ;
  string "host";
]
]}
*)

    | []  : ('b, 'b) t

  (** {3 Tag Values} *)

  val v: 'a Fmt.t -> string -> 'a v

  val uint: string -> int v
  val int32: string -> int32 v
  val uint32: string -> int32 v
  val int64: string -> int64 v
  val uint64: string -> int64 v
  val bool: string -> bool v

      [name] is the name
      of the source; it doesn't need to be unique but it is good
      practice to prefix the name with the name of your package or
